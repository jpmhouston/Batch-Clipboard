## version 2.0b3 (2025-08-30)

- Now current batch menu items are always in natural order, top is most recent to paste, even when history features are on.
- Rebuilt the Intro window panel for transition from 1.0 and confirming history on or off, improving layout to allow larger and more descriptive text, no longer focus on the menu item order but instead performance, simplicity, duplication of OS features.
- Decided option to hde the menu bar icon should be for all versions instead of only for in-app purchasers. Moved its setting from the Advanced panel to the General panel and improved its layout.
-  Added a clarification to the Advanced panel in the Settings window that saved batched are never cleared when to clear-history option it turned on.
- Fixed an issue where upon hiding the menu bar icon macOS forgets its favored position in the menu. 
- Prepare for using a liquid-glass version of the app icon on macOS 26 Tahoe, original icon on older systems.

## version 2.0b2 (2025-08-26)

- Added support for a beta channel to Sparkle updates in the non-app store version, a checkbox in the General panel of the Settings window to get betas in addition to final releases, a new menu item just below About... when an update found. If the user cancels the update alert on launch then they can use this menu item instead of going into the Settings window.
- Revise the menu items some more, tweaking the titles of several items, changing which are shown and disabled when not applicable vs hidden.
- New extra feature for the app store releases, checkbox in the Advanced panel of the Settings window to hide the menu bar icon when the app has no active batch, or when the application re-opened in the Finder (also causes the Settings window to open).
- Fixes and improvements to the application intents accessible from Shortcuts and Spotlight.

## version 2.0b1 (2025-08-20 🌭🏖️)

A substantially new version with a lot of changes. TL;DR:

- a simpler and more efficient history-off mode is the new default
- a repeat last batch feature
- in the app store version: saved batches
- improved simplicity for the menu and settings window

What's listed below somewhat exhaustively includes the many changes both visible and under the hood. The version notes in the release version will instead be less complete, and a list more like what's below will be posted on the documentation website batchclipboard.bananameter.lol.

- Implemented major feature: ability to turn history off for simplicity and system effeciency, now the default.
- When history off and without need to stay consistent with its bottom-up order, ie. most recent at the top, the current batch is now shown in top-down order, ie. first to paste at the top.
- Migrating from 1.0.x to 2.0 shows a Intro page offering to switch to the new history-off default or keep using history, the default for those users is to keep using the history features unless they choose to switch then or later in the Settings window Storage panel.
- Implemented major feature: replaying previous batch again, and support giving the menu item a keyboard shortcut (empty by default).
- Implemented major feature for app store version users who've made an in-app purchase: saving current or previous batches, each can have an optional keyboard shortcut. They appear in a new section of the menu when there's no current batch active, each with their clips in a submenu and items to replay, rename. A saved batch or individual clips within can be deleted with the same command-delete shortcut when the menu is open.
- Improved feature for app store version users who've made an in-app purchase: in-between pasting multiple clips at a time from the current batch, a new option to insert a space, newline, or comma.
- By necessity, the Undo Last Paste feature for app store version users who've made an in-app purchase is now removed in the new default history-off mode.
- Menu simplification: in new default history-off mode, no complication of a different form of the menu when its opened with the option key pressed.
- Menu simplification: the Start Replaying and Advance menu items are now hidden by default. They can be restore with an option in the Settings window Advanced panel.
- Menu simplification: the type-in filter history field, the one that's available in the expanded menu when history on for app store version users who've made an in-app purchase, this is hidden by default unless turned on in the Settings window Appearance panel.
- Minor improvements to the menu: when deleting items from the menu with command-delete the menu no longer closes, new title labels over Current Batch, Saved History, Saved Batch sections.
- Improved simplicity of how the menu is opened in reaction to clicks in hopes of addressing possible failures, stripping some unused feature of the old behavior inherited from Maccy. Added an option to the Settings window Advanced panel for reverting to the old behavior in case of incompatibilities.
- Improved layout and location of options in Settings window panels: new history switch and related menu size fields together in the Storage panel, new or improved descriptive labels in the General, Appearance, and Advanced panels.
- Improved layout and language in the Intro window, including descriptions of IAP-unlocked features in the app store version.
- Unit tests to verify correct queue, history behavior, and also general backing store correctness including migration from older versions. Improved menu reliability with sanity checking and logging of unexpected conditions.
- Migrated source to new GitHub repository that isn't a fork of Maccy.

- Address some outstanding TODOs: make more strings within source code localizable.

## version 1.0.2 (2025-06-08 🌎)

- Ship the 1.0.2b1 changes in time for WWDC 2025, defer fix for sporadic crash until more reports available.
- Changed the github workflow for the app store verison to also automatically deploy when triggered by pushed tag matching the project's version (matching non-app store workflow behavior).

- Made the github CI scripts log the build number used as the "bundle version" value in the app's Info.plist, also visible in the Batch Clipboard about box.
- Updated the readme file included in the non-appstore disk image.

## version 1.0.1b13 (2025-04-28 🇨🇦)

- Increased size of button on page 2 of the intro that opens the authentication page in the Settings app, the Check button on page 3.
- Fixed how expiration date is calculated for previewing appstore build's bonus menu items, made cycling the checkbox not reset the date to another week out. Only the lower checkbox about turning off previews in a week, turning that off and on will reset the week.

## version 1.0.1b11 (2025-04-18 🐰)

- Fixed minor error in github workflow for smoke builds.

## version 1.0.1b10 (2025-04-10)

- Added alternate menu item to start replaying the collected batch of clipboard items; beforehand the clipboard will always contain the most recently copied item, afterwards it contains the next in the batch to be pasted.

- Simplified titles of some menu items to refer to Batch instead of Collecting / Replaying.
- When starting batch explicitly rather than automatically with the shortcut, no longer stay in batch mode when all items are pasted.
- Preview bonus menu items, visible but disabled and badged, visible by default in app store version for one week before they disappear. Checkboxes to control this added to the General section of the Settings window.
- Updated the Intro window to reflect changed Start Batcgh menu items, minor edits.
- Fixed issues with the close box of keyboard shortcut fields not working in the General panel of the Settings window. Upgrading this 3rd party library dependency required increasing the minimum OS supported from Mojave to Catalina.

## version 1.0b3 (2024-10-09)

Rather than continuing to roll polish updates into b2, released it and this new one in succession in order to test Sparkle updates with a signed app.

- Minor updates to wording in the about box, intro, and disk image read me file.
- If user is hiding the status item then show the settings window when the application is reopened (for when we added back the user setting for hiding the status icon).

- Fixes to Sparkle updates that weren't running fully at launch but instead when Settings were opened, alerts that were non-responsive.
- Reset Sparkle appcast file again making a hard break between pre-1.0 and 1.0, as update that changes app name and bundle id seems problematic. 

## version 0.9.9 (2024-06-04)

- Renamed "Purchase" settings panel to "Support Us" and changed icon from a coin to a gift, fixed a typo in the panel.
- Fixed height of several settings panels, removing white space at the bottom.
- Internal refactoring and UI test.
- Fixed use of Sparkle API, updated its plist entries and added an entitlement it needed.
- Fixed build number generated during build, removed Sparkle appcast file entries for those versions with a too-large build number (so must manually upgrade from 0.9.7/8 to a new version after all).
- Improve Sparkle setup in GitHub workflow, automating appcast file generation which required making the .zip archive contain only the .app.
- Made GitHub workflow build .dmg containing app and readme (now the disk image is the recommended file to download), other GitHub workflow fixes.

## version 0.9.8 (2024-05-18)

- Changed what is left on the clipboard when collecting clipboard items in queue mode, keep last copied item on clipboard and when Paste & Advance switch to desired item before invoking application's paste.
- Fixed bug where Delete History Item wasn't enabled sometimes, particularly when there's only one history item in the menu.
- Fixed bug affecting performace where all history items were added to the menu on first launch, instead of the count in the settings, most of which then have to be removed when the menu is first opened.
- Implemented some Cleepp specific UI Tests, adapting some Mappy tests and then adding ones for using queue copy and paste.

## version 0.9.7 (2024-05-14)

- Prevent double paste when using Cleepp shortcut, or paste while Paste All / Paste Multiple is occurring.
- Disable necessary menu items when Paste & Advance, or Paste All / Paste Multiple, are occurring.
- Improve timing when copying and pasting so they work more reliably in general.
- Changed old fix for Microsoft applications support so it only applied to those applications and doesn't apply to ones for which it causes problems (specifically LibreOffice).
- Attempt completion of Sparkle support, the next version after 0.9.7 should be offered as an automatic update.

## version 0.9.6 (2024-04-16)

- Fixed regression, replay from history wasn't putting head-of-queue item onto the clipboard.
- Fixed queue item menu separator was sometimes getting left behind.

- Fixed misplaced delay when using Paste All / Paste Multiple, was letting queue advance to happen immediately after invoking paste after all.
- Created credits and licenses window containing app license, plus mentioning each swift package used and including their licenses.
- Simplified about box, added link that opens credits and licenses window.

## version 0.9.5 (2024-04-13)

- Increased the delay between issuing paste to the frontmost application and advancing the clipboard to the next item, present on Macs with Intel CPUs and for all systems in-between each paste when using Paste All.
- Used 3rd party library to draw animated GIF in the first page of the Intro window, hopefully that will work on all systems.

## version 0.9.4 (2024-04-07)

- New app icon, seen in the Finder and the about box (though your Mac may cache the old one until your next restart), and in the logo in the Intro window's first page, the GitHub README, and start of the documentation pages in the GitHub wiki. Unfortunately it's kind of a blurry mess in the small rendering in the Get Info window 😕 and I might end up changing it again.
- Made last page of the Intro window for non-App Store builds advertise the in-app purchase of the App Store build and provide button to go the app's page (although goes to a placeholder page in the GitHub wiki for now).
- Changed the support email address and documentation web address in the Intro window's last page and About box.
- Minor other changes to the Intro window's last page: fixed Copy Documentation Link button (shown when option key down) was opening it instead, added Make A Donation button opening my buymeacoffee.com link.
- Removed some unused Maccy assets.

Known issues: on either macOS versions older than 14.(tbd) Sonoma, or with less likelihood on all models with Intel CPUs, the animated GIF in the Intro window will be blank. The next release may simply show just the static logo on systems pre-Sonoma.

The app still needs to be opened the first time by right clicking the app icon and choosing Open from the contextual menu. Thank you for you patience for this last build before I deliver signed betas (or maybe one more subsequent build without).

## version 0.9.3 (2024-04-03)

- Attempted work-around for timing issues with first paste noticed on macOS 12 MacBook Air.
- Fixed menu behavior on pre-macOS14, workaround longstanding bugs, fix my logic errors.
- Stopped marking head-of-the-queue menu item (displayed at the bottom) with an underline on macOS before 14, instead put a separator line below it.
- Fixed history menu item deletion sometimes not working.
- Reordered Settings panels moving Appearance right next to General.
- Changed number of menu items in Appearance Settings panel to 20, and now say the right default in the tooltip.
- Permit entering a value of 0 for the number of menu items again, and altering the blurb below when it's 0.
- Fixed tabbing between fields in the Appearance Settings.
- Fixed preview popup to always include the line hinting how to copy a single history item.
- Fixed delete intent in case those still do something after migrating from Maccy to Cleepp.
- Improved wording in the third page of the intro, better directing what to do in System Settings/Prefs.
- Attempted work-arounds to fix the logo gif on the first page of the intro not animating on older OS versions.
- Inherit improvements to the Ignore settings panel.
- Minor code cleanup and merge upstream changes all having no effect.

## version 0.9.2 (2024-03-28)

- Restore English strings file accidentally removed while I was stripping the localizations.
- In the Intro window page 2, override the default button to be the one opening the System Settings app.
- Copying support email address by option-clicking the Intro window button was getting the mailto part also, fixed that.
- Using the Purchase or Restore buttons of the purchase settings panel now progresses through simulated states of the forthcoming purchase process.
- The purchase settings panel panel now has a link to web page about the bonus features.
- Fixed something causing the settings window to frequently open with the wrong size.

Important: Found these builds I've been making myself have all been ARM-only, though the last two simplified variants done by GitHub actions perhaps were universal. Was finally able to test on an Intel MacBook Air and there's a timing issues with the first paste from the queue. These should be fixed in 0.9.3.

## version 0.9.1 (2024-03-25)

- Hide search field options from the settings for github build or when bonus features not purchased.
- Minor improvements to the Intro window, giving pages a little more horizontal space, polished some wording, removed localization email button for now.
- Stripped localizations for now.
- Setup github continuous integration on commits to main branch, and build release when a version is tagged. Script ready to sign and notarize though not doing so yet.
- Note: Withdrawing download b/c a mistake removed made while removing localizations ended up removing some English language text as well.

## version 0.9 (2024-03-23)

- Migrated all code that modifies Maccy to turn it into Cleepp out of the experimental branch, and in the process improve the organization of the modifications. This should allow the Maccy unit test to continue to run (though untested so far) and better support future merges of upstream changes (if so desired).
- If user had started ignoring clipboard events, reset to resume monitoring the clipboard when the user starts collecting a set of item (with the shortcut, the Copy & Collect menu item, the Start Collecting menu item, or control-clicking the menu icon).
- Minor tweak to the intro: if permission has already been granted in the system settings, omit a sentence on the first page that implies that setup is still needed.
- Minor improvement when checking for purchases on launch, omitting the process (and its related code) altogether in the direct download version.

## version 0.8.5 (2024-03-19)

- Moved bonus features to app store build, for now hardcoded to be as if features have been purchased. The separate simplified build is what will eventually be available on GitHub.
- Animated logo in the intro window and the project readme (build in Drama, from PixelCut the makers of PaintCode). Something like this animation was envisioned when the name "Cleepp" was chosen.
- Simplified preview popup more still, removing last copy time line since Cleepp doesn't collapse duplicates like Maccy does.
- Fixed case where menu items could get stuck in all-disabled state (after using a feature leads to the accessibility-permissions-not-granted alert opening).
- More edits and additions to the project readme file.

## version 0.8.4 (2024-03-17)

- Added Paste All / Paste Multiple menu item, mention of it in the purchases settings panel.
- Fixed command-delete to delete history menu item, regression introduced at some point where it no longer work whenever the history filter menu item was hidden. Feature is no longer isn't implemented by the input handling in that item's text field, but by a new menu item "Delete History Item" linked to "Clear". It's enabled only when highlighting a history menu item and so can only be activated with its keyboard shortcut.
- Additional minor fixes to menu behavior.
- Feature for disabling all menu items when the app is busy commanding the frontmost application to copy or paste (especially when using Paste All). A work in progress and might require more tweaks and fixes later but I think it's the right thing to do to prevent possibility of starting another action while one is currently still in progress.
- Removed the redundant copy count line from history menu item preview pop-up window.
- Under the hood preparations for in-app purchases, eg. bringing in libraries for validating purchase receipts.

## version 0.8.3 (2024-03-12)

- New purchases settings panel, not functional yet but demonstrates its 2 states, progress spinner and error text field.
- Some sizing and minor language changes in some of the other panels.
- Added new feature where menu shown entire history (can be long, have to scroll).
- Reduces default number of history items shown normally.
- Some fixes, refactoring, simplification of the invisible menu anchor items used when not macOS 13 and earlier.
- Fixed some other menu bugs relating to deleting menu items and operation.
- Fixed minor issues with the menu bar icons, which images are used in different states of the app and transitions between them.
- Fixed preview blurb which labels actions backwards.
- Minor changes to the intro.

## version 0.8.2 (2024-03-08)

- An intro window opens up the first time running the app to help walkthrough granting the permission needed in the System Settings app, plus giving essential information for basic usage.
- It can be opened again later via a link in the text of the about box.
- If trying to use the app before granting permission and the alert is shown, the app ends up in a more predictable state afterwards.
- Menubar icons are images again so they work in older OS versions.
- Has a new app icon that's distinct from Maccy's, though perhaps it will get replaced again before 1.0.

## version 0.8.1 (2024-03-01)

- Menu bar icon based on SF Symbols clipboard when running on macOS 13.0 Ventura and later, changes appearance when collecting & replaying clips
- Reversed the actions needing the option key when clicking on history items
- Prepare for replay from history, history filtering, and undo copy features to be bonus features
- Updates to repo's readme

## version 0.8 (2024-02-23)

Cleepp is fork of Maccy that adds a new mode to the clipboard letting you copy multiple times from one place then paste them all in order someplace else. Many features of Maccy have been stripped away for the sake of simplicity.

Built off a temporary development branch, will shortly be rebasing/redoing these changes off a later commit of the main branch with some improvements to the code along the way.
